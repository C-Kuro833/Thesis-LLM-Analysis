# Bachelor Thesis LLM – Statistics Reproduction Guide

This repository contains the raw survey export and the analysis notebook used to generate all quantitative results (descriptives, reliability, rmANOVA, post-hoc tests) reported in the thesis. For qualitative analysis a coded dataset is further provided.

## 📂 Files

### Inputs
- `qualtrics_export.csv`  
  Raw Qualtrics export (as downloaded).  
  **Important:** the notebook assumes the first **two rows** are Qualtrics metadata and removes them (`df_raw.iloc[2:]`).

### Analysis
- `Statistics.ipynb`  
  The full analysis notebook. It:
  1) loads the raw Qualtrics export  
  2) applies exclusion criteria (attention + manipulation checks)  
  3) maps Qualtrics question IDs to readable variable names  
  4) computes descriptive statistics  
  5) computes Cronbach’s α (per format + overall/stacked)  
  6) runs repeated-measures ANOVA (AnovaRM) + Bonferroni-corrected paired t-tests  
  7) creates a results plot

### Outputs (generated by the notebook)
Running the notebook will create the following files in the working directory:
- `quantitative_data.csv` – cleaned quantitative dataset with renamed columns (Likert mapped to 1–7, numeric columns parsed)
- `qualitative_data.xlsx` – qualitative/free-text fields extracted
- `descriptives_all_variables.xlsx` – demographics + background descriptives (categorical n/% and numeric M/SD/min/max)
- `results_diagram.png` – exported figure (results diagram)
- `excluded_by_check.csv` – list of participant IDs excluded by attention or manipulation checks

### Qualitative analysis
- `qualitative_data_coded.xlsx` – qualitative/free-text fields extracted and coded for results

## ✅ Exclusion rules (as implemented in the notebook)

The analytical sample is filtered exactly as follows:

1) **Attention check**
- Column: `Q51_1`
- Correct answer: `"Strongly Agree"`
- Everyone else is excluded.

2) **Manipulation check (strict)**
All three must match exactly, otherwise excluded:
- `Q11` must be `"Verbal"`
- `Q38` must be `"Numerical/Percentage"`
- `Q50` must be `"Visual/Colour"`
